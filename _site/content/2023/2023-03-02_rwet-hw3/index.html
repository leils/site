    <h1>A Meme Generator Genre Study</h1>

  <blockquote>
<p>The genre study: Choose a genre or form of writing. This can be anything from a literary genre to a meme format. Gather a small number of exemplars of the genre and make a list of the characteristics that are common to all of them. Write a program that produces texts that emulate a particular form or genre of language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple setup: &quot;It's like but for !&quot; There's a whole set of tech memes about startups, where all of them are &quot;Uber but for X&quot;. <a href="https://www.quora.com/Uber-for-X-What-startups-are-working-on-Uber-for-X">This is a good example</a> of (surprisingly not satire) companies and services that are based on this model. Here's a <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/like-uber-but-for-jokes">Buzzfeed Article</a> on the same thing.
Examples: - It's Uber, but for food. - It's Uber, but for books. - It's Google, but for jobs. - It's LinkedIn, but for dates.
Pretty straightforward! So here's a quick run of this: The &quot;things&quot; are random, pulled from the top of my head.</p>

<p>It's not bad, but I wanted to be able to source my &quot;things&quot; from a database, not just manually thought of and written.
Somewhere in the long list of tutorials was a link to the <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora">Corpora Project</a>, and subsequently the <a href="https://github.com/aparrish/pycorpora">pycorpora port</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I did try this late at night, so perhaps that has something to do with my inability to make this work. At first, I installed pycorpora via pip, but that install does not include any data by default.</p>
<p>I re-installed defining the Corpora database. This gave me access to the categories I expected, but when trying to actually access words, I had a lot of issues.</p>

<p>I'll have to take another look at this, perhaps locally first (rather than through Jupyter).</p>
