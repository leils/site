  <h2>Altar V2</h2>
<p>After I figured out the direction of my altar with my cardboard prototype, I started two new avenues of prototyping: functionality, and form.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>I knew I wanted to be running multiple thermal printers at once, and printing different things to them all. I made an order for 3 more printers, and set about making a function prototype.</p>
<p>This prototype includes all the goodies of my previous setup (a Raspberry Pi, a screen, a keyboard) but gains two extra printers. I followed a “1 day to proof of concept” approach here, essentially kicking this together in a single day as soon as I had the necessary parts.</p>

<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/.11ty/image/?src=content%2F2023%2F2023-04-11_thesis-testing%2Fthesis-tests-4.jpg&width=2048&format=webp&via=transform 2048w"><img src="/.11ty/image/?src=content%2F2023%2F2023-04-11_thesis-testing%2Fthesis-tests-4.jpg&width=2048&format=jpeg&via=transform" alt="thesis-tests-4.jpg" width="2048" height="1365"></picture></p>
<p>This was built to test basically three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to direct attention from looking down at a screen to looking up at a series of printers</li>
<li>Where to place the printers in comparison to the console</li>
<li>Whether the printers would “cascade” or “pool” the way I’d imagined</li>
</ol>
<h3>Form</h3>
<p>At the same time, I started designing a form for this altar in Fusion360. I then laser-cut these altars at a smaller scale to see how they would register in real life. The laser-cut versions helped tremendously, even if they were only a few inches tall.</p>

<h2>User Test</h2>
<p>Julia and I set up in the media commons for an in-person user test. Here, a lot of things felt like they were going wrong, but they ended up giving me a lot of great feedback. Much thanks to everyone who stopped by during the feedback session.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scroll/printout placement is SUPER important. When it’s behind the altar and seemingly on a space you may not want to touch, people will not engage with them.</li>
<li>Receipt printers definitely mean folks want to tear the scrolls. The dotted lines I created to try and delineate the different stories? They look like tear indicators!</li>
<li>People have a desire to answer more than one question. Right now the have to go back through the entire experience to answer another question, which can get frustrating.</li>
<li>Kneeling is definitely an accessibility issue.</li>
<li>The prompts can get a little long, I need to re-work that script.</li>
<li>The connection between the question you respond to and the two other printouts is not yet clear.</li>
<li>There’s a chance for the chatbot/altar to have a bit more of a persona. How can it guide your experience? How can it be a reflection or mirror of me?</li>
</ul>

<h2>And A Presentation Too</h2>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/.11ty/image/?src=content%2F2023%2F2023-04-11_thesis-testing%2FThesis_-_Presentation.jpg&width=960&format=webp&via=transform 960w"><img src="/.11ty/image/?src=content%2F2023%2F2023-04-11_thesis-testing%2FThesis_-_Presentation.jpg&width=960&format=jpeg&via=transform" alt="Thesis - Presentation.jpg" width="960" height="540"></picture></p>

<p>I also have been working on a presentation! This is what I tested with my online feedback sessions with alumni.</p>
<p>The general feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m pretty well set up for my presentation. The story is clear and compelling, and my cadence is not too rushed.</li>
<li>The main missing thing is a conclusion … a wrap-up, or maybe a quote to leave the audience with.</li>
<li>I have a chance to do something clever with the words, if I so desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I’m not too worried about the presentation, but I might spend some extra time figuring out some clever ways of incorporating my actual project into the presentation format.</p>
