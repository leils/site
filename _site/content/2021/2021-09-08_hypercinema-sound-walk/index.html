  <p><em>What is hearing? What is listening?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.notion.so/HC-Week1-35116baa6ed64dd4a05a32b9ac1575ab">The Sound of Yellow</a> (<a href="https://www.notion.so/HC-Week1-35116baa6ed64dd4a05a32b9ac1575ab">full audio available here</a>)</p>
<p>This piece brought me in with a warm, bright feeling. Higher pitches rang like bells, echoing lightly in the air. This left a sense of a slightly enclosed space, feeling the sounds fall back on themselves at the edges. Undulating lower tones solidified the base of the range, and left me feeling enveloped.</p>
<p>As the speaker entered, the sound began to change, wavering in pitch to bring in a bit of minor bend and a touch of sourness. This begins as the speaker mentions some of the more negative associations with the color yellow; falsehood, decay, exclusion. As these become more prevalent, the music also introduces a near-mechanical fast pulse, like the chirping of a bird or a too-fast heartbeat. In its high pitch, I experience a sense of anxiety which is emphasized by a the voice’s lower toned bass. This shift into a heartbeat is almost uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Later, the speaker shifts into more positive associations, and the heartbeat fades at the ring of a bell. This bell ushers in a chord on an organ, low and warm like a ray of sunshine. But soon the heartbeat is reintroduced, and the poem/reading is started over again.</p>
<p>Overall the piece brings together an interesting story; the color, shifting from warm to cold and back, from comforting to deeply unsettling. While never uncomfortably loud, it still manages to overwhelm through discordant tones and a fast pace.</p>
<p>In wonder about these associations linked so intimately with the color. I wonder how the cultural context of the writer, the speaker, the creator shapes this piece. Where does the association of yellow to falsehood come from? As a Chinese American, I can only think of the biases against East Asian Persons of Color, the idea of “Yellow Peril” that ran rampant in this country (and others).</p>
<p>As a side note, I also briefly looked through <a href="https://www.ubu.com/sound/index.html">The Pirate Shadow Library</a>, and glanced through the names to find a strong lack of East or South Asian names. While this is not exclusive, I did find it interesting that there were none of the following names listed in the file titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chang</li>
<li>Lee</li>
<li>Kim</li>
<li>Liu</li>
<li>Chen</li>
<li>Wong</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not to say that the accumulation of pieces is exclusive, only that I had trouble finding this specific subset of people. And that's worth thinking about.</p>
