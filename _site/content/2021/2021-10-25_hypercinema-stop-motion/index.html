  <p>This week, we experimented with some stop motion! I worked with <a href="https://www.tatianatrebisacci.com">Tash Trebisacci</a> to create these tiny little animations.</p>
<p>To continue my obsession with the laser cutter, we decided to play around with cutting paper and cardboard. We figured it would be pretty easy to make &quot;morphing&quot; shapes (for example, the moon below) in illustrator and have them cut out, rather than trying to mould them by hand. This took inspiration from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-WM-x__BOk">Shugo Tokumaru's <em>Katachi</em></a> as well.</p>
<p>Our aim was to make simple but delightful animations. After the initial brainstorming and idea generation, we each set off on a bit of personal exploration, and came up with these.</p>
<p>Our first GIF is Tash's cute moon animation:</p>

<p>Each of the backgrounds for the moons is a snippet of Tash's handmade paper.</p>

<p>And up next, my gif of a little text &quot;Boo!&quot; in the spirit of Halloween.</p>

<p>The full effect requires a little bit of sound. I actually took this audio with my out-of-order typewriter, which has been gathering dust while it awaits a fixing.

<p>And as a bonus, the internals of the laser-cut moon:</p>

<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The faster you laser cut, the less likely you'll get burn marks.</li>
<li>Paper is remarkably easy to laser cut, and the result is very satisfying.</li>
<li>Shaky tables and wobbly tripods are the enemy. Next time, I'm getting a remotely-shuttered camera to do this with.</li>
<li>These are REALLY FUN.</li>
</ul>
