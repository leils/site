  <pre><code>ASSIGNMENT:

Please bring with you a printed photograph that means something to you personally.
This could be an archival image of a relative or place from generations ago,
a family snapshot, a childhood photo––something that elicits a memory.
Please also write a caption for your image on a separate piece of paper.
</code></pre>
<p>We viewed the chosen photos first without captions, then with. It reminded me of the &quot;space to place&quot; exercise we did in Outside the Box, where the addition of attention and intention changed the experience of a space into a Place, one of noteworthiness and care.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I used to think to think it was my rememory. You know. Some things you forget. Other things you never do. But it's not. Places, places are still there. If a house burns down, it's gone, but the place--the picture of it--stays, and not just in my rememory, but out there, in the world. What I remember is a picture floating around out there outside my head. I mean, even if I don't think it, even if I die, the picture of what I did, or knew, or saw is still out there. Right in the place where it happened.” - Toni Morrison</p>
