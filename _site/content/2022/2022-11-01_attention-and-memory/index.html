    <h1>Readings ~ Attention and Memory</h1>
    <hr>
    
  </div>
  
  <p>I’m struck by the idea of attention. What do we pay attention to, and how does it change that thing? Our experience of that thing?</p>
<p>Using attention (and intention) to change the nature of something is a theme I’ve found in both Medium of Memory and Outside the Box. In Outside the Box, we used attention to transform a space into a Place. In Medium of Memory, we used attention to transform a photograph into a story, through the use of a caption.</p>
<p>The media below reflects a new thought; what <strong>kind</strong> of attention do we pay these memories, and how does that affect the way they change, grow, or exist?</p>
<h2>Individual Media and Reflections</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/haiti-immigration-photo-essay/">There is a Name for Women Like my Mother</a>,  Naomieh Jovin</h3>
<p>There’s something special about seeing the photographs in a home; more than the photograph, the sense of place adds a context and a gravity to the photo. The frame, the placement over a door, all meaningful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By creating these photos of the women in my family, and reclaiming the images they made during their lifetimes, I hope to forestall this loss, to show the purpose and honor that defined their lives, and to actively create a new narrative for my generation. - Naomieh Jovin</p>

<h3><a href="https://onbeing.org/programs/ocean-vuong-a-life-worthy-of-our-breath-2022/">A Life Worthy of Our Breath</a>, Ocean Vuong</h3>
<p>I have so little to say about this interview that isn’t better suited to just quoting Ocean. So here, here it all is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And when you think about how people tell stories, stories are carried in the body, and it’s edited each time the person tells it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I think — because what happens is that through the body and through service, you articulate it through paying attention. Nothing can say “I love you” more than feeling it from somebody. And I think this relationship is how I started to see words. I looked at them as if they were things I could move and care for.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>… the future is … in your mouth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first generation made it here, and to live at all is such a privilege that they’re happy, and even encourage you to put your head down, work, fade away, get your meals, and live a quiet life. And I think the second generation, the great conundrum there, the great paradox, is that they want to be seen. They want to make something. And what a better way to make something and fill yourself with agency than to be an artist? So: so many of us immigrant children end up betraying our parents in order to subversively achieve our parents’ dreams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ocean says many things that I hope to one day hold on my own tongue in my own words. His way of approaching the past is one with a lot of peace in it, despite the horrors that those memories may hold.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/opinion/my-dead-dads-porno-tapes.html">My Dead Dad’s Porno Tapes</a>, Charlie Tyrell</h3>
<p>What a fascinating multi-generational uncovering. Horrifying, but comforting, a 14-minute unfolding that must have taken years. Charlie narrates the past looking back with new context, new knowledge. It’s like a type of literary suspense, where the audience knows something the characters don’t. And it’s sad, and accepting, and precious.</p>
<p>It’s kind of interesting to hear about this story from a third-person narrative. It’s somehow impersonal in this deeply personal story, maybe a way of handling it. In the end, I realized that it actually <em>was</em> narrated by someone else, not Charlie.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A monument to a respectable brand of normalcy.”  - Charlie Tyrell</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://vimeo.com/390550385">I can’t Hear the Birds,</a> Fabiola Ferrero</h3>
<p>Place as memory, not as space. The spaces are almost second-thought here; instead, the memory itself is what is living and breathing, and captures the spotlight.</p>
