    <h1>Thesis ~ Initial Interviews</h1>
    <hr>
    
  </div>
  
  <p>Things I did this week for thesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up an interviewing pipeline for folks living outside their parental/heritage culture, sent out a call to the ITP student body.</li>
<li>Began a survey for interview intake, providing me with some pre-interview data and thoughts.</li>
<li>Interviewed 4 people, a total of 6 hours of interviews. More are scheduled to take place in the next few weeks.</li>
<li>Chatted with Morgan Chen, an ITP graduate who also did research on Chinese-American second-generation immigrant experience.</li>
<li>I remain fascinated by obscuring/framing, and have done some explorations in acrylic on photography. (more about this exploration <a href="https://www.leiac.me/2022/2022-10-14_framed-obscured/">Framed ~ Obscured</a>)

<p>Things i did not do this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Much reading of my resources</li>

<h2>The Interviews</h2>
<p>In order to keep my interviews open-ended, my only two pre-defined questions were:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you consider to be your cultural heritage?</li>
<li>What is your relationship with that cultural heritage?</li>
</ul>
<p>As the interview progressed, I found myself asking how they feel connected to that heritage, and what feels like home to them.</p>
<hr>
<h2>So what now?</h2>
<p>I’m continuing to interview, and slowly sorting through &amp; processing the interviews I’ve already done.</p>
<p>Some quotes/paraphrases that stuck out to me from my interviews and survey responses (kept anonymous for now):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel my cultural identity everywhere, but in the small things; the way I dress, the food I gravitate towards, the objects I own. I’ve never actually thought of these as cultural connections, but now that I’m thinking about it, they really are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since moving away from (<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>their homeland</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>), my identity as (<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>this cultural heritage</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>) is even more solid, through needing to defend it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, I don’t speak to my parents about my feelings. I can only speak about my feelings in English, and my parents only can understand (<em><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>heritage language</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></em>) … I will probably never speak to them about my feelings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If I have kids, I’m going to make sure they speak the language. Without the language, it’s like the wires are too frayed to plug back in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I consider other immigrants “my people” and feel much more comfortable in that type of community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These interviews have thusfar led me to some new threads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultural connections being small but ubiquitous, in a number of different things that you do/have/remember.</li>
<li>Immigrant-Americans (and other immigrants) creating a <em><strong>new</strong></em> culture, being more at home in communities of diverse second-gen kids.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>To sum up my current Thesis state:</h2>
<p>I’m focused on building an exploration and expression of immigrant connection to cultural heritage, based on my own experience and cultural bridges. I’m starting at my cultural touchpoints; food, language, rituals and signifiers. I’m also exploring the unique creation of second-generation culture; in my case, the hybrid of Chinese-Taiwanese-American, and the way that unique mixture is authentic in its own way.</p>
