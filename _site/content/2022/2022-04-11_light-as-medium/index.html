  <p>Created in collaboration with <a href="https://ratanav.com">Nunnapat ‘Spencer’ Ratanavanh</a> and Bruce Mk Arthur.</p>
<p>Light as Medium was an exploration in creating motion-reactive and user-controlled light within the context of stage performance and movement exploration. Ideated and driven by Spencer’s experience as a modern dance artist, we integrated body-mounted sensors, a Kinect camera, and projector into a custom performance tool and space.</p>
<p>The snapshots below are from a proof-of-concept showcase. In all recordings, the lights projected are fully controlled by Spencer (the dancer) through his hand placement and electromuscular signals.</p>
