    <p>Created in collaboration with <a href="https://ratanav.com">Nunnapat ‘Spencer’ Ratanavanh</a> and Bruce Mk Arthur.</p>
<p>Light as Medium was an exploration in creating motion-reactive and user-controlled light within the context of stage performance and movement exploration. Ideated and driven by Spencer’s experience as a modern dance artist, we integrated body-mounted sensors, a Kinect camera, and projector into a custom performance tool and space.</p>
<p>The snapshots below are from a proof-of-concept showcase. In all recordings, the lights projected are fully controlled by Spencer (the dancer) through his hand placement and electromuscular signals.</p>

Spencer's face is not visible. On Spencer's chest and bicep are red sensors, with wires falling away from them; he is using his right hand to touch the sensor on his left bicep. Spencer is lit so that his shadow falls on the wall behind him. The top right corner and bottom half of the frame are in darkness." width="1366" height="2048"></picture></p>
<p>Spencer continued this exploration in his <a href="https://ratanav.com/Wetware">Wetware project</a>.</p>
