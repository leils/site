  <p><strong>Shatter</strong> allows you all the anxiety of breaking your screen, with all the satisfaction of having done it on purpose.
This experiment algorithmically generates each crack, matching it in size to a pitched sound of glass breaking. The end result is a remarkably convincing simulation of glass shattering, despite the simplistic implementation.</p>
<p>The first version of Shatter was as seen above, white cracks on a gray background. As there are no cracks on the screen at first, this meant that the initial state of the app was a blank, gray screen. This was confusing, and didn't give the user any inclination towards what they were supposed to do. Once shown, however, it seemed to be a convincing and compelling interaction.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/.11ty/image/?src=content%2F2019%2F2019-10-05_shatter%2Fbreak-glass.png&width=1222&format=webp&via=transform 1222w"><img src="/.11ty/image/?src=content%2F2019%2F2019-10-05_shatter%2Fbreak-glass.png&width=1222&format=jpeg&via=transform" alt="Break Glass" width="1222" height="1126"></picture></p>
<p>In order to add context to the interaction, I added this background image reading &quot;In Case of Emergency, Break Glass&quot;. Calling out a common concept, it encourages the user to try and &quot;break&quot; the screen.</p>
<p>While convincing enough of an effect in the browser, this really shines on a touchscreen device. Try it yourself <a href="https://leils.github.io/shatter-sim">here</a> (make sure your sound is on).</p>
