  <h3>dailies</h3>
<p>I adopted a daily practice starting in 2023 of doing one creative act per day, as part of a 100-day-of-making challenge. What started as &quot;100 days of words&quot;, has turned into &quot;every day, creating&quot;. My rules are loose and breathable.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It must be a creative act.</strong> A creative act is anything from painting a masterpiece, to writing a poem, to taking a single picture of something that catches my eye.</li>
<li><strong>It must be documented.</strong> The creative act gets photographed, written about, documented in some way, and put up on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/everydayaltar/">the everydayaltar instagram</a>.</li>
<li><strong>It should happen within the day.</strong> This one is ... more flexible. My aim is to do the creative act between the time I wake up in the morning, and the time I go to sleep at night. However, if it is posted before noon the next day, that's ok too.</li>
<li><strong>I am allowed breaks days.</strong> I must post that it's a break day. (Writing the word &quot;break&quot; is a creative act too).</li>
</ol>
