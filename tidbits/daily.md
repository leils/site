### dailies 

I adopted a daily practice starting in 2023 of doing one creative act per day, as part of a 100-day-of-making challenge. What started as "100 days of words", has turned into "every day, creating". My rules are loose and breathable. 

1. **It must be a creative act.** A creative act is anything from painting a masterpiece, to writing a poem, to taking a single picture of something that catches my eye. 
2. **It must be documented.** The creative act gets photographed, written about, documented in some way, and put up on [the everydayaltar instagram](https://www.instagram.com/everydayaltar/). 
3. **It should happen within the day.** This one is ... more flexible. My aim is to do the creative act between the time I wake up in the morning, and the time I go to sleep at night. However, if it is posted before noon the next day, that's ok too. 
4. **I am allowed breaks days.** I must post that it's a break day. (Writing the word "break" is a creative act too).
