title: about Leia

---
Leia S. Chang (they/them) is an artist, organizer, and creative technologist exploring unusual materiality and embodied identity. With a strong command over creative fabrication, Leia channels their perspective as a second-generation Chinese-American into interactive installations, poetic texts, and tangible multi-media objects made of wood, resin, and found materials. Their work often integrates digital media into physical forms with the aim of spotlighting the connection between memory, identity, and storytelling. 

Leia is currently an exhibit developer at the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Their work has been shown at the likes of La Mama’s CultureHub, theBlanc Art Space, the Gray Area SF and Resistor NYC. They organize creative communities and facilitate workshops on making-as-art. Leia holds an MPS from NYU ITP, and a BS in Computer Science from Cal Poly SLO.

*Once, a long time ago, a professor looked at a todo list I'd made for the day, and called it the best poem he'd read all week.*
