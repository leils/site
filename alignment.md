On 11.25.25 Spencer and I sat at Jules in the Lower Haight and talked about the drive behind your art, the thing that moves you, the running thread, and we talked circles around our own and other art practices and came out with this idea that your *thing* isn't something you can just pluck out and use, it comes from the iteration of looking at your work and others' work and eventually something comes together, and we came up with this alignment framework that you see below, a way of looking at your work and other work and asking yourself, "am I in this?". 

For each piece, answer these questions: 
1. do i love this? 
2. does this feel like me?
