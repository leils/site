On my phone I keep a note for the year, a place to stash ideas and inspirations, words that I like, things to look up for later. I built a shortcut that allows me to jot things down and automatically add them to the note, with an empty line separating it. 

I don't pretend to remember all of what these words mean, but they meant something to me at the time, enough to write them down. 

This is 2023.

i should be working on my thesis right now. 

laser-cut felt wreath. Will require a core. 

what urges are passed down 
digital molting 

electronic candle that flickers more when you blow on it 

“I don’t really like it but everyone else does, so i guess let’s do it” 

adulation: "servile or insincere praise" -> This is usually said to be from ad "to" (see ad-) + a stem meaning "tail," from a PIE *ul- "the tail" (source also of Sanskrit valah "tail-hair," and Lithuanian valai "horse's tail"). The original notion would be "to wag the tail" like a fawning dog (compare Greek sainein "to wag the tail," also "to flatter;" also see wheedle).

wit: to know, "mental capacity", 

bibliomancy 
wikipedimancy 
rhapsodomancy 
wandermancy 

the food my downstairs neighbors make smells like GOD 
i come home and it’s just 
Oh god do i want whatever is cooking up on that stovetop

A glimmer of a notion of a nothing of a whisper of a figment of an idea. - Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow 

The way to turn an ex-lover into a friend is to never stop loving them, to know that when one phase of a relationship ends it can transform into something else. It is to acknowledge that love is both a constant and a variable at the same time.

FIELD NOTES - SF MOMA WITH CONVERSATION PIECES AND THE VISITORS 
- furniture all in one. lots of love.  
- chair made of clay, coated in a protective plastic layer 
- un-fragile hanging piece 
- furniture meant for and not meant for the home. Meant to challenge. 
- lights! oh gosh the lights. not task lights, but beautiful ones. 
- a flocked rock that i wanted to touch desperately 
- chairs that question the nature of their materials 

A Review of The Visitors
Literally just an incredible show. Created of a single hour take, multiple rooms of a house are recorded and each musician gets one. The directional sound and intimate shooting make it feel like you are a part of a precious, fleeting moment even as you know it will run again as soon as it’s over. You whip your head left and right at the different rooms, trying to catch glimpses of everything happening at once 
I feel the splash of the bathtub, the throb of the bass. I smell the smoke of the cigars, the sticky sweet champagne, the musty sheets. I feel the air cool as they leave, walking barefoot into the grass. 

“extremely approximately” 
a year lasts approximately forever 

useless machine: comfort dongle 

“a light snack” light 

in our own words 

the preciousness of material, the ability to be in-precious about it 
to be an artist, the art cannot be precious
it needs to be like water 
something you pour and drink and consume and wash away 

boredom as the key to novelty 

sometimes we frustrate ourselves on purpose 
as if the everyday challenge wasn’t enough 
challenges are an escape 
if they’re surmountable 

butt bombed into oblivion 
is a great band name 


if i could stop time for a second 
i’d take the extra moment 
in bed 

Nothing is ever “from scratch” 
you did not build the wood you carve from 
the sun 
the dirt 
have done so much before you. 

I don’t want to be scared anymore 

today is made for me to do what i can, and take care of myself 
there are some things to do, to take care of, like laundry and cooking and grabbing coffee. and there are other, larger things to tackle, like designing and planning a large fabrication project, like figuring out what to do with the words. 
there’s plenty to do but also it’s not the end of the world. You can take your time. Do it right. Let yourself think. 

I feel like there should be alt text poetry 

gaze upon my flesh and perish

receipt paper + lighter 
the lighter moves to write something 
but your challenge is to keep it a certain distance from the lighter 
otherwise it burns 

there’s not much left to the light 

if I lean a little to the left 
and squint 
there’s some time left 

may the transit gods be ever in your favor 

I want to create a shortcut they will automatically add any text or right to the end of this note 

have you ever noticed that altars and vanities have the same shape 

the joy is from the fact that it's personal 
so make it personal 
personal but open 

What is the precious part of the thesis? How do you hone in on those precious parts? 

Why do we want radical honesty in social media? Partially to allow for groundedness in our feeds, but also because to some extent we desire it to be known that everything about ourselves, even iur random thoughts, are cool. 

if we can have a language model imitate sound but not produce meaning  (ie parrot complexly, but not actually "know" what it's doing) 
this is like the dogs with the buttons 

i should backlight my thesis, and add smaller lights to the edges of the altar to spotlight receipts in the dark 

What are the world's smallest pilgrimages?
- to the store
- to the dining table
- to the fridge
- to your bed 
define pilgrimage. define small. 
hello adnan 

have you ever just felt a bus gun it? 
like the driver found an opportunity to be on time and today, just this once, decided that the thrill and the rush were worth it. somehow my phone is at 40% battery and i've just started the day. somehow i see an open window that i want to climb through. somehow i'm stuck in traffic again with a bus driver that won't budge an inch, which is probably for the best considering how many people are on this bus with no seatbelts or other safety equipment. if we crashed, my face would smash directly into this metal handrail, and then perhaps i would suddenly and unpleasantly have no teeth to speak of. if we crashed, the other car would probably have bigger problems. if we crashed, would the city of new york pay for my medical bills? my tuition? 
i don't think i got enough sleep last night. 

today everything is listing to the left
can't catch my breath 
compensating but always off kilter

two nerds and a bag of dirt

what if i leave this place and lose my artistry? what happens then? how do you hold onto what feels important?

how many moments have you forgotten to write about? forgotten to capture on camera? to live in the moment is ideal but even the best ones can use a token to trigger their re-emergence. you can gather tokens like a slot machine, like a gum-ball dispenser, listen to them clink into a pile, sift through them with your fingertips.

### Early Warning Signs of my Impending Doom 
an autobiography (or for now, just a list)
1. the unassailable desire to make, do, or generally be productive at all times 
2. new website creation at 2am 
3. the recurring thought, "just one more thing" 
4. using sound as brain-filler 
5. a lack of a consumption of tea

practice googling things 
practice writing down silly thoughts 
practice being confused 

things that are comforting:

Diasporic stupidity is looking for an eastern witchcraft, and forgetting about all of the spirituality that exists like feng shui

Is the vision of the future leisure or purpose? How can both be true?

all i do is complain about things and be better than you 

I've worked with words for 161 days now and you know what I don't actually think I'm any fucking better at it, I think I've made 161 things and yeah that might be some kind of achievement but like come in it would be nice to see some sort of measurable improvement for once 

this is candle not holder 
and what is it inside? it's a mess

if AI is the new industrial revolution, then the only legislation that i truly think needs to exist is the limitation on creating people or false personas. the disintegration of truth through the use of false personas has been proven time and time again to be distasteful to humanity as a whole despite the type of industry 

One day, god willing, I'll have a journal for almost all the years i've been living as an adult. 40, 50, a book for every year. I think that in of itself will be a sight to behold.

What is the reason is Joy?

My shorter commute has a 22nd window, where the train enters the open air, just long enough to clinch the sky. My longer commute stays above ground, the whole time, meanders their houses the way you might expect a secret passageway to take you to a new world between the Ivy.

I had read enough child psychology to know that this was normal enough, that a parent, at this phase, is in essence sacrificial, that she must, in order to inspire the child's long-term confidence, survive her own destruction. A parent, I had even heard, is merely a fixed spot on the wall that the child can look to, should she need to regain her balance. I knew this all in the abstract, of course, but in practice, I was not a dot on the wall, an immutable shape on the horizon, and I found that the destruction merely had the desired effect of destroying me.

Their relationship had been frayed already, I had comforted myself, a tooth so loose it needed just the lightest of tugs. Elle settled in the corner of the room at a little table set up just for her. Maude stood and moved toward her, kissed her on the head. I had done the tugging, sure. Had held the bloodied tooth in my palm.
~ Sarah Freeman

"Very lucky," I said, feeling my face redden.
I had dozens of questions, but none of them came to mind; instead I half-listened, not knowing what to do with the time: it would be over too soon. I did not want to go without saying some-thing, something of importance, and then it was time for a snack, Maude told Elle, and when a single thought did come to me, you can have him back, I was already outside, remembering now that I had forgotten the bag containing the scarf, which I had laid next to me on the couch, and then it was gone, the thought, the pur-pose, the scarf, in the muddle of our encounter, and now the front door was shut, a blue, endlessly dark blue door, much darker than my daughter's room where I pulled the curtains shut, even though it was only four in the afternoon, and even then, it was still not dark enough in the room, so I lay under the weight of her floral duvet, the one we had chosen together, and I wept, oh what a fight there had been about this duvet, a battle at every turn. She wanted this one, but in a different color. Your eyes will be closed, you won't have to look at it anyway, and she had cried and told me I knew nothing about duvet colors, nothing about her.

something to think about a lot is how access to tools makes us feel more capable. with the right tools you can carve your own spoons. with the right tools you can build your home from the ground up.  The Internet came along. Suddenly we were all writers, we were all publishers, we were all bloggers. When TikTok came along, suddenly, we were all video makers, and we wanted to be what about all the other tools, the ones that are digital.

Google Translate re-writes my name as Zhang Liya.

It makes sense, because in English, the spelling of Leia implies a “lei”, a “lay”-like sound. And the 立 is “lee”.
