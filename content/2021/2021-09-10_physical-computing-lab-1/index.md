### Basic DC Setup

Let us embark on the first steps of physical computing. First, a bit of setup:

Above is a basic DC input setup with regulator. I soldered the jack to some headpins and hot-glued them for security.

Above, lighting a single LED.

When setting up this DC input, it should be noted that the voltage regulator can only be used when also using a wall plug providing 9-12 volts. If the source provides less than 9v, you won't get much power on the other side of the regulator (a mistake that I made and was confused by for far too long).

### LEDs

Up next, a few basic things with LEDs. An LED lighting up, LEDs in parallel and series, and hooked up to a little switch.

Adding up voltage:

- The switch is is 3V closed, 0V open
- Resistor is 1v, each LED is approx 2V

When a third LED is added in series, the LEDs light up but only barely. Not enough power is being supplied to the LEDs, as each LED needs approximately 2V to work.

### Switches

Here, we learn to use a potentiometer, switches in series and parallel, and how to attach a motor.

### A Custom Switch

Lastly, let me leave you with a little custom switch. This may be the most expensive switch I've ever used.
