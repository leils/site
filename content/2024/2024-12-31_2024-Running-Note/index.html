    <h1>2024 Running Note</h1>
    <hr>
    
  </div>
    <p>On my phone I keep a note for the year, a place to stash ideas and inspirations, words that I like, things to look up for later. I built a shortcut that allows me to jot things down and automatically add them to the note, with an empty line separating it.</p>
<p>I don't pretend to remember all of what these words mean, but they meant something to me at the time, enough to write them down.</p>
<p>This is 2024.</p>

happy new year 

storytelling weaving baskets 

lamination as a signifier of importance 
Lamination as a time stopper, preservation 
Laminated things as name tags, placards 

the hands of my mother 
(materials: tools: what created them) 
symbols of labor 


a digital essence you have to tend daily 
or it will die 

lines drawn on the floor 
how we naturally choreograph 

i can't get to freedom without you 

education, agitation, and organizing 

double stacked apple box shelf 
crochet garland of leaves 
hang the post cards in the hall 
hang the painting on the wall 
a corner for reading and give it light 

the only way to keep the object from becoming junk is to keep its context close by 
what does it look like to label, attach the stories of all your objects 

i cannot say that i understood what i have just seen 
but i can say 
that i am struck 
as when hit with the light of day from the dark 

A little website where every time you click, it walks a character, but if you click too fast, the character slips

your practice as a diary 

what is mediated through your platforms? your work, practice, ideas, opinions? 

why is everything a Cold War 

a palimpsest off chance encounters 

what the hell is a global citizen

Traveling unburdened is the greatest luxury

the work of an artist is to stand in awe and wonder 

three texts, clicking changes the three 

the rain sometimes cleans, sometimes washes away, sometimes drums, sometimes just fucking gets everything soggy 

as a note: they SUCK

i wonder if so many &quot;holy&quot; or &quot;sacred&quot; objects in white culture are socially acceptable to be parodied because they live in organizations of power; there is no way to NOT &quot;punch up&quot; when making fun of them 

The goal of so much white Christian culture has been historically to spread, proliferate, and conquer. Essentially, to share these values symbols and religions, as far and wide as possible. If the goal, historically, has been to spread and share the symbols, what does that mean about cultural appropriation? Is it possible for minority culture to culturally appropriate like Christian culture if the whole point for the last many years has been for it to spread?

jesus saves but jesus is a pinterest web bookmark app 

PCB dollhouse

Lightning bug PCB

Should i use AI for this? 
&quot;I dunno, I'm a computer. I shouldn't make decisions about anything.&quot; 

pcb that an led noodle is meant to wrap around 

the city is full of young trees 

what are the aesthetics of accessibility 

inflatable tampon 

rules of grounding 
1. when your train goes above ground, look out the window 
2. no airpods when walking outside 
3. look up 

wheredrop 

puffer vests that inflate when your valuation goes up 

puffer vests that inflate more when you're near another startup founder 

airdrop for news you don't wanna say out loud 
&quot;i'm gay&quot; 
&quot;i'm sorry your mom died&quot; 

besotted by the version of Hamlet starring Andrew Scott 
for the first time, understanding the full meaning of the play 

a newspaper for your friends

hello 

i want studio mates 
people in the workshop that are doing their own thing and building, making, sharing, inspiring 
i want a space to hang my work, try new things, let the works in process breathe 

fix it day at the shops 

stitching together the past and the future 
taipei and san francisco 
LA and NY

positional qr code 

qr codes that are not qr codes 

custom wet paper embossing, embossing animations 

How much energy does it take for me to doomscroll?

the use of ai in the theme parks space is actually extremely compelling in creating realistic, individual interactions with a character 

in a makerspace community, every gathering should have a set of legos. 
we need a box of something to break the ice, to let you idly build, to get into the &quot;create&quot; mindset without breaking out the big tools 

how do you hold a space? a physical one? a digital one? 

Look up when there's a view 
Sit in the sun 
Airpods away 
Look for change 
Leave your laptop at work 

pop up rules 
make something move, sing, talk, critique 
with paper, trash, wood
in 29 minutes, in an hour, in three days 

Yesterday I: Went to work. Taught two classes, helped a bunch of students out with their work, graded a series of worksheets, helped clean up after lunch, returned a dress, learned how to put in contacts, submitted my jumpsuit measurements, made dinner, handed off work to our attendants, 

The day before I don’t even remember. I must have done something; Paul was gone. I cleaned the house, did laundry, emptied the dishwasher, tidied the living room. 

Today I: brought a typewriter to school. Built a soldering station. Tidied and cleaned up my desk, replaced the ink in a marker, got us both coffee. Helped some students understand circuits, scheduled some things, emptied the shredding stuff. Used the table saw. Watered my plants. 

Brain wall with section for main project, side project, ideas on ice 

A camera that takes images and sends them to a storage place elsewhere, like a box at home. You can only see the images when you go to that place, &quot;retrieve&quot; the images, and print them out. 

how can you store pins on the lid of an altoids box 
can I make a built-in pin storage there 

mere mortals: the machinery of mankind 
seas of people 

what things around us have a memory? a digital one? a physical one? 

praxis salon 
craft night but specifically for makers 

studio share lab 
turn my space into your studio 
just for an evening 
share what you're excited about and what you want to learn 

a community lab, a make sesh, a place to cross pollinate skills and ideas 

raku firing using your childhood journals, drawings, artifacts 

a built in cabinet with room for a record player 

charm and harm sit quietly on the floorboards next to each other 
pretending to be strangers 

poetic computation like making a pillow out of metal 

phone autocorrect that changed &quot;I&quot; to &quot;AI&quot; 
&quot;AI went for a walk today&quot; 
&quot;AI made a sandwich for lunch&quot; 
&quot;AI felt pretty sad about the state of the world&quot; 

repair, reuse, reprogram 

do objects generally cool down and warm up at the same rate?

including your children in the &quot;how was your day?&quot; conversation, from before they can talk 

making sure to give your children independent space so they can have updates on their own 

Forbidden area stairway to nowhere, insulation that is a staircase into another floor that clearly should not be able to exist

how do you build your positivity in as a default? how do you shape your space that way? what's your upward-looking invite? 
&quot;Share one moment of satisfaction from this weekend&quot; 
&quot;tell me the highlight of your morning&quot; 

TCC tough conversation club 

reuse, repair, reprogram 

&quot;I'm going on airplane mode for the next X hours&quot; 

a stamp, a sigil, for yourself that we use to stamp your projects and notebook and so-on 
at the end of the year, we use these to stamp your project, and you get to take it back with you as a symbol of your readiness to sign the work you've made 

ending on moments of satisfaction, revelation, connection 

go forth and enjoy the day, the celebration is just beginning 

do people clap at the end of movies, of flights, because they desire a sense of closure and squeeze-release? 

In the age of instant gratification, there's not much that's bound by time anymore. You don't wait for your favorite tv show to come on the air, you don't feel lucky when you catch your favorite song on the radio. 
Instead, things are money bound. Some are both time and money bound, like going to a concert or a touring artist. But your books, your movies, your music ... it's money and not time.

you can tell how long a bus driver has been driving by the way they handle the intersection of Church and 16th. The left turn isn't particularly sharp, but the power rails lean to the right, and threaten to detach from every bus that makes its way underneath. 
I once overheard two bus drivers talking about this intersection as an enemy. To attack it, they said, was to drive straight forward at the pole, to almost hit it, and to weave the other direction at the last minute, as if to trick the cables into thinking you weren't going to turn at all.

art installation that's an anonymized list of all the times you got screwed over

where you slowly optimize and evolve something into uselessness
