    <h1>Space To Place</h1>

    <pre><code>Assignment.
Work as a solo artist to create a Space Becomes Place Installation for a classmate to
experience IRL.
You will seek a found Space and transform it into a Place.
R&amp;D

1. SCOUT- Go out into the world (safely) to choose an IRL site
 Seek evocative atmosphere &amp; narrative potentiality- a site ripe with possibility for
response or interrogation. Choose a Space that conjures a sense of Place.
2. TAKE TIME TO WITNESS YOUR SITE
 Take field notes
o What do you see? what story does the space tell you? What is its dialect?
o Note any found objects, human tagging, energetic residue. Let them to
talk back to you about their secret life in this place.

3. IDENTIFY NARRATIVE POTENTIALITY
 Document: Snap 4 raw documentation photos of 4 compelling found
compositions you see that already exist without your intervention (for ex:
amidst architecture, object, figure, light, image)
Create an Installation

1. STAGE 4 TABLEAUS
 Style/Fabricate the 4 found compositions using only what is already onsite +
whatever you have on your person.
 Explore scale &amp; proximity/distance.
 Document: Snap 4 photos that capture the 4 staged tableaus. (proof of concept)
2. CURATE A JOURNEY for an intended viewer
 Feature your 4 tableaus on this journey
 Define its beginning &amp; ending. Curate a clear and compelling &quot;entry&quot; &amp; &quot;exit&quot;.
 Let music underscore this journey
 Feature recorded sound of you speaking any favorite excerpt(s) from your field
notes, treating as &quot;found&quot; text as you artfully repurpose your language.
 The whole journey should be 2 minutes in length.
Don't overthink.
Go with your gut.
Act on your impulse.
This is an exercise in creation led by listening and responding.

<p>This week, I created an experience in the Moynihan Tran Hall, Platform 13.</p>
<p>The thing that struck me about Moynihan train hall was the stark difference between the waiting hall upstairs and the platform downstairs. The large-scale, open, lit area above feels extremely modern and polished, to the point of sterility. The train hall below is dark and cavernous, with screeching sounds of trains and constantly moving people.</p>
<p>Julia experienced my curated path on a rainy day. It wasn't by any means perfect, but it sure was interesting.</p>

<h2>Lessons:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wayfinding is a difficult task, and takes a lot of thought.</li>
<li>Spaces can change! One of my original chosen tableaus disappeared overnight.</li>
<li>Don't try to film and send instructions at the same time.</li>
</ul>
