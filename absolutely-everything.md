This website strives to be honest. At the bottom of this page is every page of this website, including the css and readme, including this one, some of which that are un-navigatable otherwise. I like the idea of a website like a maze, like a theme park ride queue, full of surprises and tricks if you're there for long enough. Will you read my stories? Play with my toys? I hope some of the things you stumble upon feel special, a gift, a poem.

About the website: 
The site is written in 11ty, a process seeded in 2024 and truly sprouting in 2025. It's hosted on Netlify, using Github Actions to automatically build and deploy. It strives to make as little use as possible of package dependencies and outside libraries, a goal of minimal tech for maximal longevity.
