This website is, as all things, a work in progress. It's unpolished. But at least it's honest.

At the bottom of this page is every page of this website, including the css and readme, including this one, some of which that are un-navigatable otherwise. I like the idea of a website like a maze, like a theme park ride queue, full of surprises and tricks if you're there for long enough. Will you read my stories? Play with my toys? I hope some of the things you stumble upon feel special, a gift, a poem.

I strive for this website to: 
- **be honest** *(it is what it is, it is html and css and js, it generated from markdown, it is a labor of love, it is useless and pragmatic, it is a portfolio, it is an archive, it is a playground)*
- **be charming** *(can I shape the joy of surprise in this internet space? will you sit here a while longer if I do?)*
- **grow** *(inconsistent, as it may be. how can the site shape itself? can it grow without me?)*

About the site: 
The site is written in [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a process seeded in 2024 and truly sprouting in 2025. It's on [Github](https://github.com/leils/site), using Github Actions to automatically build and deploy. It strives to make as little use as possible of package dependencies and outside libraries, a goal of minimal tech for maximal longevity. It was written out of an exhaustion at struggling to maintain the previous version of this website in Gatsby. 

I use [this custom script](http://localhost:8080/content/2020/2020-04-19_Gatsby-Post-Generation/) to generate a template within my desired file structure when I write a new post.
